# Introduction to Haskell

## Functions
In Haskell a function is a mapping tht tkaes one or more arguments and produces a single result and is defined using an equation that gives a neme for the fucntion, a name for each of its arguments and a body that specifies how the result can be calucleted in terms of the argument.

When a function is applied to actual arguments the result is obtained by substituting these arguments into the body of the fucntion in place of the argument names. 

## Functional Programming
What is functional progamming? Functional programming can be viewed as a style of programming in whihc the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. A functional programming language is on the supports and encourages the functional style. 

## What Haskell Can Offer You
- Substantially increased programmer productivity (Ericsson measured an improvement factor of between 9 and 25 using Erlang, a functional programming language similar to Haskell, in one set of experiments on telephony software).
- Shorter, clearer, and more maintainable code.
- Fewer errors, higher reliability.
- A smaller "semantic gap" between the programmer and the language.
- Shorter lead times.
