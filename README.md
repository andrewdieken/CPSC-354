# Exercises

**Exercise (Algorithms):** Choose a simple algorithm and formulate it as a rewriting system as in the exercise on sorting above. *Write a blog post about it.* Add in as much as you want and can of the material we learned so far.

- Answer.

  - diff(0,x) -> 0
  - diff(x,0) -> x
  - diff(s(y),s(x)) -> s(diff(y,x))



-add extra examples

**Exercise:** Write a program in your programming language that contains a while loop or recursive calls and show termination by exhibiting a measure function. Write a blog post about it.

- Answer:

**Exercise:** Go back to your class on data structures and algorithms and find an algorithm based on a while-loop and analyse it from the point of view of invariants and partial correctness.
