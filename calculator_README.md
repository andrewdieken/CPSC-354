# Simply Haskell Calculator
This is the read me for our groups simply Haskell calculator


To start off our project our group wanted to create a simply calculator using our programming language, Haskell. We wanted to build this first because there was pleaty of documentation and the concepts were fairly easy to grasp.

### Run Instructions
1. First you will need to download [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/mac.html)
2. You will need to download the [calculate.hs](https://github.com/andrewdieken/CPSC-354/blob/master/calculator.hs) file
3. Once steps 1-2 are complete, all you need to do is run the command `runghc calculate.hs` in terminal
4. The program will wait until it is given input

Example input:
-  `12 + 4`
- `12+4`
- `45 * 8`
- `45 - 8`
- `12 / 4`
- ``
